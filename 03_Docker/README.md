# Docker Test

This test is used to test your basic Docker knowledge. Do not worry if you do not know Docker.

## Prepare

- We suppose you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed on your PC.
- There is a folder `api_holidays`, this folder contains simple Python script (it is copy-pasted from `02_Python` assignment).

## Assignment

The goal is to dockerize script inside `api_holiday`. The output should contains:

- [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) - that will create an Docker image.

Then open [results.md](results.md) and fill bash commands for building and running container.

Create new branch e.g. `novakj/docker` (user surname + first letter of your name - e.g. Jan NovÃ¡k => `novakj`) and push this branch to git.

Test should take **<1 hour**.

**Good luck!!**
